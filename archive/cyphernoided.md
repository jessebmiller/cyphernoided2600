# Cyphernoided

A gritty tactical conflict driven narrative cyberpunk game.

# Concept

// remove the specific revenge concept, keep that paranoid conspiracy shit

In a cyberpunk future

You play a paranoid lowlife whose had to learn to survive, sometimes by means the
establishment can't understand, sometimes by means that hardened you more than
you'd wished, sometimes by means you never thought you'd have to employ. You
can't trust the status quo and for good reason. While you've never been drawn to
conspiracy theories without some reason you understand that this world was not
made by good will and honest dealings. You understand, like all lowlifes, that
the game has been rigged against you.

You've found youself at the edge of a true conspiracy, you can feel it, you know
it. It has taken something dear to you and you've vowed to take your justice by
your own hand and your own judgement.

You'll buy, borrow, or steal the weapons, cybernetics, connections, drugs,
anything you need to get revenge and you'll die doing it if you have to.

# Aim

Make progress towards your revenge. What means will you justify to succeed? What
will you sacravice?

# Tone

Dark, paranoid, serious, action, noir, tactical, conflict driven.

# Subject matter

Violence, revenge, neurodivergency, mental illness, class struggle, oppression,
conspiracy theory, body horror.

# Setting

Neo-feudalism the logical conclusion of the collaboration between fascism and
capatalism. Strict heredetary social structures. There are owners who have
money to own things, and there are serfs who work for a place in an owners
business (feif). No pay, they work for food, clothing, and shelter.

Lie of a hierarchy that is "merit based" in the corporate maner. Meaning a
narrow view of merit, and large classes of skills and value ignored and
devalued. The lie of upward mobility is used as a carrot to give workers hope.

Businesses are organied in a tree structur or pyramid based on land and
resource ownership being granted down the tree in exchange for a percent of
proffits and the operation of security teams to be coordinated by the parent
coporation and its owners.

Some people opt the fuck out and live by whatever means they can muster. Bet
that lying, cheating, or stealing they live in the cracks of neo-feudalism.
There is pays to be paranoid. Some call them runners, and you're one of them.

# Actions

/*

This section is written for an audience that knows Blades in the Dark. I won't
define terms that are defined in Blades and I'll generally be describing how
things differ from blades here. This'll obviously change when this document is
written for a broader audience

## Action Ratings

ther are 12 actions as in blades. They are devided into three "arenas of
conflict" rather than attributes but they work the same way.

**Physical Violence**

* Power
* Speedrun
* Endure
* Sneak

**Cybertech**

* Netrun
* Chromejack
* Codepatch
* Cypherhack

**Social Engineering**

* Convince
* Manipulate
* Intimidate
* Bribe 

When you do something challenging make an action roll as in blades.
The process is the same, state goal, choose action, set position and effect, discuss.

The dice you roll, unlike blades, depend on position (not action) and are
modified by an action or reaction rating depening on whether what you are doing
is proactive or reactive, whether it's offense or defense. Action and reaction
ratings range from -2 to +2 so 0 pips gives a -2 rating and 4 pips gives a +2
rating. Life's hard. Action ratings are read like blades. Reaction ratings are
read vertically like blades resistances.

* In a controlled position roll 3d4 + rating
* In a standard position roll 2d6 + rating
* in a desparate position roll 1d12 + rating

on a 10+ success
on a 7-9 mixed success
on a 6-  failure

In addition, for any die that rolls a 1, the GM holds 1 which may be spent at
any time to do one of the following.

* tick a clock in any direction
* add a clock
* shift position or effect

Of course a GM can and should be doing these things in the regular course of
play, but this hold give them permission to be a little harsher or more
surprising than they otherwise would be.

# Noir Renaissance
---

600 years after the fall of the UN and its member nations (weather and
AI war apoc) Technology advanced and the population grew enough to
support a widespread discourse and fascination with pre-fall (player
current day) culture and ideas. What the greek and roman culture is to
the Renaissance, 2023 global culture (US, EU, China, Japan, Korea,
English speaking internet etc.) is to the noir renaissance

Tech advanced with a focus on the analogue up to this
point. Particularly interested in interfacing with and augmenting
individual bodies and minds as opposed to the intellectual and
information focus that led to the AIs and their crushing war.

A global communication network was built with a focus on face to face
style meeting.
